# Web DB Browser

This is a webbased databse browser for SQLite-Databases.

## Developement
### Frontend
The Frontend was created with React.js. 
You start the Frontend with:
```js
   npm start
   ```
### Backend
The Backend was created with Python. I used the Framework Flask and used the Routes for the REST-API to provide the information of the database for the Frontend.
You start the Backend with:
```js
   python main.py
   ```
